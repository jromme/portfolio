You all know the feeling. Saying no to people with the arguments: “I’m too busy right now”, “I’m not prepared for that” and so on. I am no exception to this rule. My sister Charlotte asked me to join her in the obstacle run called: The Battle of Maestricht. At first I declined. The tickets were too expensive and I was not prepared. One argument was shattered when Wim (boyfriend of Charlotte) managed to get a free ticket. The other argument I refuted myself. After two months without sporting, I was ready for some physical overdo. A slim and muscled body -ahum- transferred into a body with rich lovehandles and a talking belly button. My Nephews from Friesland were the ones that eventually persuaded me to sign in. For they live in the North and I live in the South of The Netherlands, this was the perfect opportunity to hang out on a different activity, other than boring christmas dinners. Now, the decision was final.

> The waiting began for the moment when the shit hits the fan

Our group was a group of four people. My two nephews Paul and Mark, my sister Charlotte and myself. I was the only greenhorn in the group for Paul and Mark are familiar with these kind of runs. Charlotte trains two times a week in the area where the battle of Maestricht was about to take place. So you can say I was just asking for trouble. While the other three were training, all I had done the couple past months were sitting, programming and eating. But I was curious. Not curious about the fact if I would die during the run, more about how many times I would die during the run… There are some kinds of suffering that I am addicted to. Burning muscles, sweat poring out of your body and the sheer survival of every step you make are one of them. I missed this feeling the last couple of months.

Before I knew, I was standing among a crowd of well prepared people, waiting for the run to begin. After shouting the war cry: “All for one, and one for all” the run began and there was no turning back.

I won’t go into details about every step and obstacle we made, but instead I will tell you about the most euphoric and miserable moments of my run. The first couple of kilometers and obstacles went better than expected. I even grew a bit arrogant and started to provoke Mark by overtaking him on obstacles. If only I knew… 

Running long distances is something you have to master while doing these kinds of runs. When you possess this skill you can actually recover while on your way to the next obstacle. Well. I clearly did not. After the obstacle named [“The Weaver”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0qIjzG04U) I was mentally and physically wasted, broken, demolished, kaput. But there was no time for self-pity. The pack was already moving on.
After this miserable moment the moment of euphoria followed rather quickly. While I was on survival-mode, counting my steps and trying to control my breathing, the next obstacle was already approaching: 

> A 4-meter high vertical wooden wall 

I could see people slipping down after a failed attempt to reach the top. Others were helping each other to overcome the obstacle. Me, you ask? I refused to be helped. It would be the icing on the cake if I succeeded in one try, without any assistance. It was all-or-nothing. After a split second of preparing I ran as fast as I could, jumped and placed my left foot as high as possible against the wretched wall. The next step was crucial: trying to hold my vertical momentum as I reached high to grab the top of the wall. Before I knew, I was up and over the enormous wall which resulted in a tremendous adrenaline kick. Where moments ago I were surviving, the next moment I could tackle the world again. What a wonderful feeling. All pumped up and energized we went on. There were only a few kilometers left. The finish line was just around the corner. You could practically smell it. After a sprinkle of color dust, we joined arms together and crossed the finish line as a team.

> Happy days
